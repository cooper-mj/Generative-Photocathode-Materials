Michael, Makena: onboarding.
The file load_dataset.py contains the code for extracting and loading the
dataset into the models. The file logistic_regression.py contains an example
of loading the unit cell dataset into train, validation, and test sets, and running
a simple model on the loaded datasets.

The datasets which can be loaded into the project are:
- unit_cell_data.csv - unit cell representation.
- unit_cell_data_16.csv - expanded unit cell representation.
- material_average_data.csv - average properties representation.
- material_average_data_plus.csv - expanded average properties representation.

Early investigating of PyGAN library:

Makena: google cloud setup
Created our project on the Google Cloud Platform and sent invites to Jason and Michael.
We are awaiting a quota increase, so I will notify everyone when all resources are 
set up.

Michael: updated dataloader to return two values: X, Y.
X - unit cell representations for all molecules with Y[i] < 0.5.
Y - corresponding y values. 
In this way, we've got a pre-filtered dataset to train the model on.
