  abstract = 	 {In this paper we introduce new methods for the improved training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis. We construct a variant of GANs employing label conditioning that results in $128\times 128$ resolution image samples exhibiting global coherence. We expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, $128\times 128$ samples are more than twice as discriminable as artificially resized $32\times 32$ samples. In addition, 84.7\% of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data.}
